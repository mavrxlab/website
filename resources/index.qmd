So you want to try out some virtual reality equipment, or perhaps you need a place to develop graphics or video. The MA{VR}X Lab provides the space and equipment to do this free of charge to all students, staff, and faculty at the University of Arizona. Those outside the university community and established collaborators may still request access to lab resources. Please follow the [participation guidance](../about/).

Here is a(n incomplete and ever-growing) list of different resources available within the MA{VR}X Lab. Stations, equipment, and other resources can be reserved using our reservation platform. Please email MAVRX-Lab\@arizona.edu for access.
