  The theme of this event was *Into the Metaverse*. As more of the “big-hitters” in the extended reality (XR) Industry express their vision, interest, and investment in the next disruptive platform, the “Metaverse” has become a common expression of what that will be. How that will impact the way people learn, train, live, work, socialize, travel, and entertain within the next decade is important for us to understand, prepare for, and leverage.
