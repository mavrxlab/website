What does this have to do with the lab, you might ask? Why, space, of course!

As the Patterson Observatory is also owned by the University South Foundation and [the lab completed the 3D scan of the observatory](https://mavrxlab.org/post/patterson-observatory-3d-tour/) recently, we've teamed up again to provide attendees of the Dine Under the Stars fundraiser with a virtual reality accompaniment. Donors were not only given access to the 20" telescope in the observatory, but also to the [Space Engine](https://spaceengine.org/) universe simulation software in the lab.

Here's [a recording by Reddit user `BerkeA111` of just how amazing this experience is](https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengine/comments/pykuca/such_a_view_i_just_love_it_could_stare_for_hours/):

How mind-blowing is that? You can find the original video [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/u/1/uc?id=1yGIMCC26Im39LlxH9ZhLsocbjxmDBJBJ&export=download).

What else will we have? A way for folks to pick up a star or a planet and turn it around in their hands using [the Merge Cube](https://mergeedu.com/cube).

We'll also be providing [a POAP NFT](https://poap.gallery/event/8980) to anyone that stops by.
