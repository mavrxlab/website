In this brief presentation I'll be discussing our exploration of AI-generated case studies in cybersecurity ethics education through a posthumanist lens. This work represents a shift from traditional human-centric approaches by embracing AI not just as a tool, but as a collaborative agent in developing educational materials. Our informal pilot study with 25 students revealed fascinating insights about this human-AI pedagogical partnership. As you can see in the graph on the right, we tracked three key metrics: student engagement, learning outcomes, and topic effectiveness. The blue bars represent percentage scores above 75% in each category, demonstrating strong initial results. This isn't just about using AI to create content--anybody can do that these days--rather, it's about recognizing AI as a co-participant in the educational process, what Katherine Hayles might call a 'cognitive assemblage' between human and machine.

The integration of AI in generating case studies demonstrates what Rosi Braidotti calls the 'posthuman convergence' where human and technological agencies become intertwined. Looking at our innovation metrics on the right, we see particularly high scores in scenario development and ethics coverage - over 85% effectiveness in both areas. This isn't coincidental; it reflects how the human-AI collaboration could address complex ethical scenarios from multiple perspectives simultaneously. The bar chart shows four key innovation areas: scenario development, student feedback, learning integration, and ethics coverage. Notice how the integration scores, while still strong at 78%, are lower - this represents the ongoing challenge of seamlessly incorporating these posthuman approaches into traditional educational frameworks.

Here we have a rather compelling story about student engagement with this posthuman pedagogical approach. Looking at the darkest blue segments at the top of each bar, we see strong agreement across three key measures: capturing interest, engagement versus traditional lectures, and motivation for deep thinking. Over 72% reported high engagement, indicating strong acceptance of this posthuman pedagogical approach. What's particularly interesting is how the 'More Engaging than Lectures' category shows the highest proportion of strong agreement - suggesting students may actually prefer learning from materials that emerge from human-AI collaboration rather than purely human instruction. This aligns with what philosophers like Karen Barad describe as 'intra-action,' where meaning emerges through the relationship between human and technological actors.

This visualization breaks down learning outcomes across three key areas: understanding key concepts, confidence in application, and grasp of complexities. The green color scheme represents growth and development, with darker shades indicating stronger positive responses. Note how the 'Understanding Key Concepts' bar shows the highest proportion of strong agreement, suggesting that the human-AI collaborative approach was particularly effective at conveying foundational ideas. This effectiveness stems from what posthumanist scholar N. Katherine Hayles calls 'distributed cognition' - the way knowledge emerges through interactions between human and technological systems.

## Development Process {.smaller}

### Methodology
1. Module Design
   - 7 core modules
   - Integration with NSA requirements
   - Focus on practical application

2. AI Collaboration
   - Claude 3 Opus implementation
   - Iterative refinement process
   - Student feedback integration

::: {.notes}
Process details to highlight:
- Each module carefully aligned with NSA knowledge requirements
- AI generates initial scenarios based on learning objectives
- Student collaborators provide crucial feedback
- Iterative refinement ensures quality and relevance
- Continuous improvement based on implementation feedback

Here we see our development methodology visualized as a Mermaid flowchart, illustrating what Karen Barad calls 'intra-action' in practice. Starting with course objectives, moving through AI generation, student review, refinement, implementation, and feeding back into refinement - this isn't a linear process but a dynamic assemblage of human and non-human actors. The feedback loop represents how both human and AI contributions evolved through iteration. Of particular note is how we used Claude 3 Opus for scenario generation - not as a tool to be wielded, but as what Donna Haraway might call a 'companion species' in the creative process. This posthuman approach meant the scenarios weren't simply human-authored cases about technology but emerged through genuine technological co-creation.

::: {.notes}
Important elements to emphasize:
- Each scenario includes multiple types of documents and perspectives
- Characters represent different stakeholders in cyber ethics
- Social media elements add realism and contemporary relevance
- Timeline allows for development of complex ethical situations

The bar chart on the right shows the relative importance of different scenario components, with documents and ethics scoring highest at 95% and 94% respectively. This structure reflects what Braidotti calls 'transversal connections' - crossing traditional boundaries between technical and social elements. Each scenario includes background documents, character profiles, social media elements, and timeline progression, creating what I call a 'posthuman narrative assemblage.' Looking at the purple bars, you can see how policy and ethics components rank nearly as high as technical documentation - this balanced integration is crucial for posthuman pedagogy where no single perspective dominates.

::: {.notes}
This visualization uses a purple gradient to show effectiveness across ethics, policy, and law. The stacked bars reveal something fascinating: areas traditionally considered 'human-centric' like ethics show the highest effectiveness when taught through human-AI collaborative materials. This supports what Cary Wolfe describes as the 'posthumanist paradox' - by decentering human authorship, we actually enhance our ability to grapple with human concerns. Notice how the 'extremely effective' and 'very effective' categories dominate the ethics section, suggesting that the posthuman approach particularly excels at conveying complex ethical concepts.

We've moved on a bit from the scenarios we created prior to class. Here are how some were introduced to the students.

The qualitative feedback themes, shown in the blue bar chart, reveal five key areas: real-world application, interactive learning, critical thinking, privacy awareness, and ethical considerations. The frequency of these themes, particularly 'Critical Thinking,' aligns with what posthumanist scholar Stacy Alaimo calls 'trans-corporeality' - the inseparability of human cognition from technological environments. Students weren't just learning about technology; they were learning through and with technology in ways that transformed their thinking processes.

Key future directions:
- Planning comparative studies between AI-generated and traditional case studies
- Developing more interactive elements based on student feedback
- Expanding scenario library to cover emerging topics
- Building partnerships for broader implementation

Looking at our development priorities chart in green, we see four key areas for expansion: effectiveness research, content expansion, tool development, and cross-institution implementation. These priorities reflect what posthumanist theorist N. Katherine Hayles calls 'technogenesis' - the co-evolution of humans and technology. The decreasing height of the bars represents our staged approach to implementation, but each stage involves deepening the human-AI collaborative relationship.

The final chart shows our areas for development, with interactive elements scoring highest. This prioritization reflects our commitment to what Catherine Adams calls 'posthuman inquiry' - recognizing that education happens through complex networks of human and non-human actors. The blue bars represent not just improvements to be made but opportunities to further blur the traditional boundaries between human teacher, AI collaborator, and student learner.
