The **M**ixed **A**ugmented **V**i**R**tual e**X**tended (Reality) Laboratory in the College of Applied Science & Technology is the University of Arizona's home for research, exploration, and development for alternative and extended reality media and training in southeastern Arizona.

We take a very broad view of "extended reality" to include everything from head-mounted displays, volumetric video, digital identity, and more.
