Here at the MA{VR}X Lab, we believe people should get credit for the things they do. This includes engaging with the lab! We've adopted [POAP](https://poap.xyz) as a mechanism for achieving this.

What is POAP? Check out [*What is POAP?* by Cooper Turley](https://medium.com/poap/what-is-poap-d7e8fdfc207d) over on Medium. We've put together our own brief introduction, as well, that explains just how we'll be using it (or, planning to, anyway!).

See the _Related_ links below that outline just how and why we're getting involved with this amazing little community-driven project.
