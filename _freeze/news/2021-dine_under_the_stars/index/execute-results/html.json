Why, space, of course!\n\nAs the Patterson Observatory is also owned by the University South Foundation and [the lab completed the 3D scan of the observatory](https://mavrxlab.org/post/patterson-observatory-3d-tour/) recently, we've teamed up again to provide attendees of the Dine Under the Stars fundraiser with a virtual reality accompaniment. Donors were not only given access to the 20\" telescope in the observatory, but also to the [Space Engine](https://spaceengine.org/) universe simulation software in the lab.\n\nHere's [a recording by Reddit user `BerkeA111` of just how amazing this experience is](https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceengine/comments/pykuca/such_a_view_i_just_love_it_could_stare_for_hours/):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% youtube \"Y7BPlWE1Aww\" %}}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHow mind-blowing is that? You can find the original video [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/u/1/uc?id=1yGIMCC26Im39LlxH9ZhLsocbjxmDBJBJ&export=download).\n\nWhat else will we have? A way for folks to pick up a star or a planet and turn it around in their hands using [the Merge Cube](https://mergeedu.com/cube).\n\n[::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://blog.airsquirrels.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog%20Images/B327%20-%20AR-VR%20Christine%20Danhoff%203/teacher-screen-mirroring-merge-cube.gif?width=900&name=teacher-screen-mirroring-merge-cube.gif)\n:::\n\n](https://blog.airsquirrels.com/edtech/how-to-teach-virtual-and-augmented-reality-merge-cube-explorer)\n\nWe'll also be providing [a POAP NFT](https://poap.gallery/event/8980) to anyone that stops by.\n\n[::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](poap.png){width=320}\n:::\n\n](https://poap.gallery/event/8980)\n\nSee you there!",
