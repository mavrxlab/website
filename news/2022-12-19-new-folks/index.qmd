Cyber Operations\
Undergraduate Researcher\

I am a junior within CAST and I will be earning my degree in Cyber Engineering. I've always been interested in the Cyberspace and how various factors affect it, especially when it comes to privacy. I would love to complete labs on Cybersecurity Awareness and Fidelity to Reality, Posthuman Inquiry into Cyber, Virtual Reality Fitness Coaches and Parasocial Relationships, and MA{VR}X. My career goal is to become a Cybersecurity Architect or Network Architect. After I graduate, I intend to go to graduate school, and I believe that this research experience will not only help me develop internally, but also serve to make me a more competitive applicant. I love fashion, walking, technology, video games, movies, traveling, and photography.

Software Development\
Undergraduate Researcher\

I am a Senior with CAST earning a degree in Software Development. My pet project would be creating software for a full dive rig. I need more information with the interaction of the brain//human interaction in an altered reality as I personally have only dove into VR once for about 3 minutes. My goal is become a Software Engineer from a 10 year manufacturing career. I have a wide array of hobbies and enjoyments- from food, painting, TV shows, movies, anime, video games, and Magic the Gathering which I leisure with my Husband, Brand.

I am Studying MIS and Accounting. I am really interested in VR and its applications in training professional athletes. I recently was able to tour the Penn-State football facility, and I got to see how large football programs use VR when it comes to training their athletes. My Hobbies are coding, watching college football, And lifting weights.

Neuroscience and Cognitive Science\
Undergraduate Researcher\

I study Neuroscience and Cognitive Science because of my interest in the neuropsychiatric disorders. I would like to complete a lab affiliated project around the neuropsych disorders and XR/VR. I am hopeful this research experience will make me a more competitive neuroscience PhD applicant (I start applying Fall 2023). Fall of 2022 I got a great new dog, Vaughn, who I spend a lot of time caring for. I'm a big fan of door dashing food, watching niche youtubers, and daily cardio.
