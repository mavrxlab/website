Cyber Operations\
Undergraduate Researcher\

I am a junior within CAST and I will be earning my degree in Cyber Engineering. I've always been interested in the Cyberspace and how various factors affect it, especially when it comes to privacy. My career goal is to become a Cybersecurity Architect or Network Architect. After I graduate, I intend to go to graduate school, and I believe that this research experience will not only help me develop internally, but also serve to make me a more competitive applicant. I love fashion, walking, technology, video games, movies, traveling, and photography.

Software Development\
Undergraduate Researcher\

I am a Senior with CAST earning a degree in Software Development. My pet project would be creating software for a full dive rig. I need more information with the interaction of the brain//human interaction in an altered reality as I personally have only dove into VR once for about 3 minutes. My goal is become a Software Engineer from a 10 year manufacturing career. I have a wide array of hobbies and enjoyments- from food, painting, TV shows, movies, anime, video games, and Magic the Gathering which I leisure with my Husband, Brand.

Pre-Business\

I am Studying MIS and Accounting. I am really interested in VR and its applications in training professional athletes. I recently was able to tour the Penn-State football facility, and I got to see how large football programs use VR when it comes to training their athletes. My Hobbies are coding, watching college football, And lifting weights.

Neuroscience and Cognitive Science\
Undergraduate Researcher\

I study Neuroscience and Cognitive Science because of my interest in the neuropsychiatric disorders. I would like to complete a lab affiliated project around the neuropsych disorders and XR/VR. I am hopeful this research experience will make me a more competitive neuroscience PhD applicant (I start applying Fall 2023). Fall of 2022 I got a great new dog, Vaughn, who I spend a lot of time caring for. I'm a big fan of door dashing food, watching niche youtubers, and daily cardio.

Cyber Operations: Engineering\
Lab Volunteer\

My name is David, and I am a Walmart associate turned CAST student studying to complete a BAS in Cyber Operations with an Engineering track. I've always been a bit of a tech nerd and enjoy building and troubleshooting computers and devices. As I've delved further into the topic of Cybersecurity I've become more fascinated by how data works and how our lives are so intertwined with our digital footprint as well as the presence we have out there with technology. Whether we realize it or not. I'm also really fascinated about VR and seeing where things will go in the future as well as how Cybersecurity impacts and will impact our future in a virtual and augmented world. I would personally love to see the world move in a direction that is hybridized to include the kinetic world and the VR/AR world ubiquitously. I really think that kind of a world would be amazing to live in. My other hobbies include spending time with my cats, video gaming and watching anime.
