  abstract = {In time, phenomenology has become a viable approach to conducting qualitative studies in education. Popular and well-established methods include descriptive and hermeneutic phenomenology. Based on critiques of the essentialism and receptivity of these two methods, however, this article offers a third variation of empirical phenomenology: Postphenomenology. The article introduces postphenomenology, a philosophy of technology that highlights the importance of technological mediation of experience: Technologies transform our perceptions (amplify/reduce) and translate our actions (invite/inhibit). Based on this framework, two approaches to empirical fieldwork are suggested: In-depth exploration of the typical use of a given technology and critical comparison of multiple versions of a technology. It is argued that using postphenomenology as a research method helps researchers explore technological mediation, a vital and oft-neglected aspect of educational practice, but the method simultaneously entails epistemological commitments such as multistability, reflexivity, and posthumanism. The article concludes by discussing future challenges for the postphenomenological method.},

I review and expand on insights from the phenomenological tradition of philosophy, and apply them to the study of computer interface. In particular, I consider Don Ihde's philosophy of technology. His work examines the various ways that humans use technologies to act on and experience the world. This perspective is useful for drawing out the habits of experience that enable a computer user to approach such a complex and ever-evolving machine in a causal and everyday manner.},

Postphenomenology is a research perspective which builds on phenomenological and pragmatist philosophy to explore human\textendash technology relations, but one with open methodological questions. Here, I offer some thoughts on the epistemological processes that should be (and often implicitly may be) at work in this research. In particular, I am concerned with postphenomenological research on technological ``multistability,'' i.e., a device's ever-present capacity to be used for a variety of purposes, and to always be meaningful in multiple ways. I develop a methodology called ``variational cross-examination,'' which entails the critical contrast of a device's various stabilities. As a set of instructive examples, I draw on my own line of research on the politics of public spaces, and especially the critique of anti-homeless design.},
