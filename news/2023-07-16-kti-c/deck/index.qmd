## Metaverse {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
According to @parisiSevenRulesMetaverse2021, there are 7 Rules of the Metaverse:

Rule #1: There is only one Metaverse.

Rule #2: The Metaverse is for everyone.

Rule #3: Nobody controls the Metaverse.

Rule #4: The Metaverse is open.

Rule #5: The Metaverse is hardware-independent.

Rule #6: The Metaverse is a Network.

Rule #7: The Metaverse is the Internet.

"What is the metaverse?" I hear you asking. And rightfully so.

These are "axiomatic" goals for an ideal metaverse, many of which I'm on board with. That said, there are some issues to address around, in the least, equity.

1.  Within rule one, there is the caveat, "controlled by none and accessible to all" complicates the matter: in practice, this is not and will likely never be the case. Oppressive government regimes, bandwidth deserts, digital redlining, barriers to technology acquisition like financial or accessibility issues, all make this difficult to realize, which brings us to Rule 2:
2.  The metaverse being defined by the rules is something closer to a pure, perfect Platonic form, in that the implementation of the metaversal concept is necessarily limited, even corrupted, by those involved in its manifestation.
3.  I think if the events of the past year have shown us anything, it's that while there shouldn't be a single point of governance or failure in the metaverse (much like there isn't one company or organization that "owns" the internet), we are certainly in *dire* need of regulation. If a scam *can* be perpetrated, it will be. For more on regulation in the metaverse, @rosenbergRegulateMetaverse2022 "Regulate the Metaverse: Why regulation is important and urgent."
4.  Again here we see a need for regulation or at least a common goal for the greater good, akin to net neutrality. My worry is that convenience will out-weight autonomy going forward and the little injustices will begin to add up.
5.  We return to the question of equity at this point. The rule is intended to mean it can't only be those with thousand-dollar VR headsets accessing the metaverse, rather it's designed in such a way that there is equity from the start. As we'll see when we get to the utilization of NFTs, a clear focus *away* from commercialization and consumerism should be at the forefront.
6.  It is interesting that so much talk about the metaverse focuses on the structure and the things within and not *the people* involved. Without users, the metaverse is meaningless. This means accessibility and usability, especially when bringing education into the mix.
7.  The internet describes a destination or locations within that space. We stream "from YouTube." We "go online" to find information. We buy devices connected "to the cloud." If we're truly considering a metaverse, we need to reform our understanding of its proximity to us and think of it more as an aether, a (dare we say) *meta* reality that is simultaneously present combined with our own.

So there we have our seven rules (and some concerns) about the metaverse.

There's an internet addage about the different iterations of The Web. Very simply, it goes like this:

1.  Web1: Read (most folks didn't have the knowledge or ability to actually build in the web)
2.  Web2: Read/Write (now folks are actually building the web, themselves, with blogs and social media and whatnot)
3.  Web3: Read/Write/Own (users have agency and their work is now *theirs*)

What I want folks to do here is to decouple their preconceived notions and associations between Web3 and *scam*. We are still very much in the exploration phase of Web3 and its potential. We'll return to this in a bit.

::: notes
That necessarily brings us to the question: what's a blockchain? I found one piece that simply called it "a chain of blocks," but I feel like there's more to say than that.

So how does this relate to education? Specifically, higher education? Lots of ways!

-   A full e-learning platform [@lamBlockchainenabledElearningPlatform2022]
-   Lots of research on blockchain-based microcredentialing [@alsobhiBlockchainbasedMicrocredentialingSystem2023; @ferdigExaminingBlockchainProtocols2022]
-   Using blockchain for online discussion or to support education records [@sousaAIBlockchainNew2022]
-   Using it in relation to MOOCs [@liMOOCsChainBlockchainbasedSecure2022]
-   Even to build an entire Smart University [@aslanBlockchainBasedLifelong2020a]

First, here's the super simplified version of how a blockchain works: each new "transaction" has a proof of the previous transaction, and this goes on forever. That way you can tell nothing has been injected, altered, or removed.

I'm sure your gears are starting to turn and you're thinking, "Hm, immutable records? I can see how that would be beneficial for an education system, whether that's for ownership and intellectual property or keeping track of credentials or..." And I'd say: good! But there's more before we return to that.

::: notes
Tokenomics is basically the science behind an economy (broadly defined) that runs on tokens. Cryptocurrency, NFTs, new forms of tokens, et cetera.

Taherdoorst makes a number of observations when it comes to NFTs. First:

"The proponents of cryptocurrencies promise enhanced artist compensation, disintermediation, and better compliance with impending anti-money-laundering rules as business reasons for these collaborations ... however, there is little proof that it, compared with other online monetization types, helps artists' problems in earning a livelihood."

So, when it comes to valuation, there are two main concerns:

"The first concern is whether or not there is a standard methodology for establishing the value of NFTs. The second goal is to define the link between NFTs and other cryptocurrencies."

And they hit it on the head with: "There is a growing amount of support and conviction in the potential of NFTs, but there is still considerable ambiguity over the future of NFTs."

And we'll come back to how these relate to education shortly.

::: notes
The DAO is essentially the native community structure of Web3. Some are more like co-ops while others are just a tech-focused way to organize a business structure and exist solely to help the members make money.

There is also the occasional question of how robust a DAO is. One DAO thought by buying an original Dune book they owned the copyright to it, which is obviously not true and something anyone with even passing knowledge of copyright law could tell you. Another DAO was completely taken over by one person (or one group of people) suddenly owning the majority of the voting power in the organization, essentially making it "theirs." And since DAO decisions (very often funding-related as they can have large amounts of money for seed grants, et cetera) are based on so-called Smart Contracts that are nothing more than algorithms, those decisions are enforced automatically.

So, again, we see an area for concern and something to watch. I don't believe this is a failure of the concept or the intent behind building these organizations, however. More like a lack of safeguards and due-diligence.

Most education-related DAOs actually focus on education on and *about* Web3 (so, helping coders learn relevant languages). DAOs focused on using Web3 for education *not about Web3* are few and far between.

But all these things bring us to what we're really here to talk about: Ed3. First, though: how are these technologies already being applied in educational spaces?

::: notes
If we follow Scott David Meyer's version of Ed3 as analogous to Web1, 2, and 3, we can start off like this.

Ed1: was knowledge transfer provided by accredited institutions, such as universities and schools. If you want to think of this in Freireian terms, you could consider Ed1 the "banking" model.

Ed2: was centralized platforms distributing education, such as Udemy, Skillshare, and Outschool, with some cohort-based engagements.

Ed3: "individuals gathering skills from a variety of sources and validating that knowledge in their own wallet."

But is that it?? Here the "ownership" comes in. In Ed3, according to Meyer, "learners own their education - validating their knowledge with decentralized technology in contrast to previous models."

And, if you're like me, you might be struggling here. On one hand, you might think, "Yes, down with the megacorps who own all our data!" On the otherhand, you might be thinking, "But, let's just take accreditation, right? If I'm looking for a platform or organization to engage with and learn from, I kinda *like* the idea that there's a body that regulates and accredits an organization to say, 'Yup, they actually know what they're talking about because we have these standards and they meet them.' I'm not sure I have the time or even knowledge to validate every *wallet* to make sure they're all legit before learning from that person." If there's anything we've learned, it's that "Just trust us" is never good enough.

Am I simplifying things here? Of course.

But, returning to Ed3, there isn't just one version of it. In fact, there are many. So let's explore some now.

::: notes
What is Ed3? Well, it depends on who you ask.

-   It can be an entire movement.
    -   In fact, if we talk about Web3 as a movement and not a specific thing, that's probably the best analog. Hence the name.
-   It can be a mindset.
    -   For many folks in the Ed3 world, it *is* a mindset. A way of thinking. A typically optimistic look at revitalizing and revolutionizing what many see as a faltering if not broken education system. They often see it as a way to return agency and ownership of learning to the learner.
-   It can be a community.
    -   And this is where the present study comes in: there is a distinct Ed3 communtiy, Ed3DAO, and I wanted to explore just what makes them tick, why are they passionate about this, how do they see the future of education in light of these technologies we've talked about, and how are they actually implementing it?

So, while we're interested in all of these, of course, it's the community's application of the concepts involved that we're really focusing on. So let's look at the study.

::: notes
-   I've been interested in the Web3/education intersection for some time.
-   I then found the Ed3DAO and joined the community.
-   It was the--if I'm being honest--scammy nature of NFTs and crypto that got me thinking, "Why are these folks so positive on this? There's no money in this." Turns out that's important and...
-   In fact, this is one of the ways the community thrives: folks looking to flip an NFT for a quick buck soon realize the ecosystem being built is not ripe for that kind of thing.
-   So, *how* are they different? That is, how do educators approach Web3, NFTs, etc, differently from those in other industries?

## Studying Ed3

![](assets/qualtrics.png)

::: notes
Working with some of the folks in the Ed3DAO to tease out some major relevant themes like focusing on Web3 as a concept, equity in education, and so on.

I asked for demographics (of course), self-reported feelings of expertise when it came to the conceptual, technical, and practical sides of Web3, a Likert-style portion specifically aimed at "the integration of Web3 and education," and then finally some open-ended questions to help tease out nuance. A cleaned, anonymized version of the data will be available once the study is published, so those open-ended responses won't be included as they may be identifiable.

As far as the Likert questions go, they were formulated as statements with which participants should agree or disagree on a 7-point scale ranging from "Strongly disagree" to "Strongly agree" with an option for "Don't know/No opinion." For example, "Schools will be quick to adopt these new technologies," "There should be more regulation and oversight," and "Cybersecurity in Web3 is of little concern."

The questions were placed in three categories, unbeknownst to the participants, focusing on equity, pedagogy, and Web3.

The instrument itself is reliable with an alpha level of `0.86`, which is nice.

First, how am I defining "educators" and "non-educators?" Simply this: a question asked participants which industry they're *generally* in. Anyone that chose Education over the others (ie, entertainment, finance, et cetera), were labeled "Educator," and everyone else was labeled "Non-educator."

The participant numbers came out to roughly 2:1 educators to non-educators. Not surprising. What *was* surprising was where similarities were and were not.

Demographics? Yup. No significant differences between the two groups.

Expertise? Again, no difference. That's those conceptual, technical, and practical expertise I talked about earlier. There were slight differences between educators and non-educators but in this particular group they weren't *statistically* significant.

So let's look at the differences.

## Difference: Teaching

This difference requires some unpacking and I encourage folks to muse in the chat about why this might be.

First: more time teaching. This would suggest, as one would expect, the non-educators perhaps don't understand the day-to-day logistics of teaching.

For the sense of community: that's interesting, right? Given the DAO-focus so many Web3 folks tend to have, it's curious that non-educators would tend to doubt the ability to build community using this technology.

Both educators and non-educators scored most highly on a survey item about NFTs not being used to their fullest extent. Out of 7, the average was basically 6, far and away the most agreed-upon optimistic thing in the entire survey.

I interpret this to mean a couple different things: first, folks in this study generally seem to believe in the utility of NFTs and don't necessarily fall victim to letting current scams and illegalities rampant in the NFT space as indicative of the technology, itself. Second, given this population is implicitly related to the Ed3DAO community, their exposure to the Ed3 NFT and its built-in utility provides them with a paragon of what's possible.

Taking this further, it then makes sense to suggest that, if improving the public opinion on NFTs is a goal, then having that paragon of utility and legitimacy is key.
