::: notes
The plan for today is to explore the basic concepts needed in order to really dig into how these technologies interact with and afford changes in online learning.
As we're still very much in the early stages of this, much of it will be necessarily theoretical or look toward *potential* rather than a *postmortem*.
That said, we'll do our best to tease these things out.

Next we'll take all these concepts and try to bring them together into a meaningful concept: namely, Ed3.

After we've established what that is, we get to the meat of the thing: I wanted to know what educators thought about these possiblities.
So, I asked them.
I will share some preliminary results from a recent study.

Next, we'll look at what this potentially tells us about the future of this space.
How can we make it successful?
What do we need to be wary of?

Finally, I'll share with you a toolkit for delving into this space for yourself.
I've put together a lengthy collection of resources, platforms, and guides for you to use.

So, let's get going!
