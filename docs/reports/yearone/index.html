<p>In an effort to quantify and summarize the projects and accomplishments of the lab during its first year, follows is a report that addresses a) the contractual obligations of the director and how they were fulfilled, b) the people that have been directly involved, and c) the wide range of events, projects, and public-facing exposure.</p>
<!--# This report is available both in a [web version](https://mavrxlab.org/reports/yearone/index.html) and [PDF](https://mavrxlab.org/reports/yearone/index.pdf).-->
<section id="contractual-obligations-of-director" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Contractual Obligations of Director</h1>
<p>This is how the various contractual obligations Dr Straight has for directing the lab are being addressed in the 2021-22 academic year. There has been some consolidation in terms of categories and expectations to reduce redundancy within the report.</p>
<section id="lab-presence" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lab-presence">Lab Presence</h2>
<p>These requirements focus on the lab’s presence. Charges:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ul>
<li>Maintaining the lab’s physical presence, virtual, and social presence</li>
<li>Develop an inventory system &amp; complete inventory</li>
<li>Conducting an inventory of all assets currently maintained by the college, identifying what new technologies are needed, and develop a budget for those items.</li>
<li>Manage all lab equipment to include updates and maintenance.</li>
</ul>

</figure>
</div>
</div></div></div>
<p>Completed in summer 2021 and consistently maintained as equipment moves in or out of the lab. An automated internal inventory system integrated with the purchase tracker has also been created. This is part of the deep integration approach the lab has taken with Microsoft 365’s work collaboration suite including Teams, Planner, Tasks, and Lists.</p>
<p>The lab also uses Clustermarket’s “Bookkit” inventory platform (see the <a href="#fig-bookkit">Figure&nbsp;1</a> screenshot for the Matterport Pro 2 camera’s page in the system). This is an invite-only, equipment/space/service booking/purchasing system. It tracks inventory, usage, maintenance time, services offered, equipment costs, and long-term checkout of equipment. Dr Straight has been collaborating with colleagues that also run labs or engage with considerable amounts of hardware to a) encourage them to use the same service, and b) connect the labs to encourage collaboration and equipment sharing.</p>
<p>After completing the lab’s inventory, the effort began in concert with the Applied Technology department head to update lab equipment where necessary and determine, given the lab’s general direction, what new equipment would need purchased to support internal and external projects like research studies and public-engagement events. A draft budget was developed and has been mainly successful in meeting initial needs. The director put together a collection of <em>wants</em> and <em>needs</em>, most of which were fulfilled. Budgeting in a lab of this nature is difficult due to the break-neck pace of technological advancement in the extended reality and related spaces. However, the detailed inventory tracking previously described allows the lab to keep a record of hardware release dates, purchase prices and current valuations, and wear-and-tear based on usage.</p>
<p>The lab, enjoying a foundation provided by <a href="#managing-equipment">previous college projects</a>, is now in a position to let purchasing decisions be driven by faculty and student research interests, funded projects, business propositions, and customer/patron needs. More on this in the <a href="#funding">funding</a> section.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>During his weekly time in the lab (typically on Mondays), the director spends time updating hardware, firmware, and software. He occasionally would bring equipment back to Tucson to continue work throughout the week. As part of the adoption and consolidation of the variety of disparate sources into the lab, all equipment needed factory reset and updated from zero<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Additionally, lab-specific accounts across the variety of services and platforms were created for consistency and ease of use across lab team members. Assistance from the IT department was crucial.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Lab equipment came mostly from the Innovative Learning project and VIPER.</p></li></div></div>

<ul>
<li>Work with marketing person to confirm brand and develop and implement the Virtual / Social Presence of the VR Lab while maintaining proper branding and alignment with CAST’s overall plan. {#marketing}</li>
</ul>

<p>The college hired a public communications specialist and a marketing specialist, both of whom have been in close collaboration to ensure the lab has official, approved branding. See <a href="#fig-official-banner">Figure&nbsp;2</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, for social media and other platforms where the University of Arizona association is otherwise very clear (as per <a href="https://brand.arizona.edu">Brand’s</a> best practices)–i.e., a Twitter or YouTube homepage–a more eye-catching banner was created. See <a href="#fig-youtube-banner">Figure&nbsp;3</a>.</p>

<p>The lab’s social media presence, public-facing content, and internal mission are all engineered to be in alignment with <a href="https://azcast.arizona.edu/about">the college’s stated mission</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Preparing our students for success and helping our communities thrive.</strong></p>
<p>The College of Applied Science &amp; Technology (CAST) provides opportunities for students to earn high-quality and meaningful University of Arizona degrees at sites throughout Southern Arizona, including key border communities in Cochise and Santa Cruz Counties. CAST partners with community colleges to offer regionally-relevant transfer programs that are low cost, and geographically accessible.</p>

The method to set up the more complex experiences are outlined in the lab’s <a href="#protocolsio">Protocols.io</a> collection.

<p><strong>With a headset</strong>: either <em>Richie’s Plank Experience</em> or <em>theBlu</em> as neither involve much movement or require learning complex controls.</p>
<p><strong>Without a headset</strong>: the Merge Cube by Merge Labs, which provides an augmented reality experience with any smartphone or tablet. See <a href="#fig-merge">Figure&nbsp;4</a>. This is the device that featured in the <a href="#heraldreview">Herald/Review story</a>.</p>

<p>This was placed on hold, as per Applied Technology department head (2021 August). Given the changes in CAST undergraduate curricula and the potential PSMs and CIIO graduate programs, this will return to the forefront in 2022-23 or whenever the undergraduate-to-graduate pathway is clear. Likewise, the director and other colleagues are planning on submitting a <a href="https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-experiences-undergraduates-reu">Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)</a> proposal to support “active research participation by undergraduate students in any of the areas of research funded by the National Science Foundation.” Specifically, this will be based in CIIO with a focus on extended reality, broadly considered.</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a consortium by engaging college faculty, community colleges, other Universities, and government partners. Creating a regular schedule of meetings to create goals and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In collaboration with UA-ARC, Fort Huachuca, and Bryan Carter in Digital Humanities, we’ve partnered with Optical Sciences to establish a universitywide VR group to make a solid, coherent push going forward. This is in addition to the “Digital Twinning” efforts currently in process.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ul>
<li>Continue weekly meetings with the UA-ARC, Huachuca, Main campus VR team.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These meetings, referred to as the “AR/VR Tag-Up series,” shifted to bi-weekly at the start of the 2022 calendar year. The director consistently attends the meetings and, in his absence, Diana Saldana would attend.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ul>
<li>Develop and manage community engagement events in connection with the VR Lab</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Community engagement events were some of the highlights of the first year in the lab. COVID, obviously, has had an impact on this but we were still highly successful and visible. With the hiring of Dean Packard, a variety of different events were planned without the lab needing to host or manage the entire event. Details provided later in the report.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ul>
<li>Collaborate with the other labs in the college, university, and region.</li>

<p>Though the number of labs and centers related to extended reality is relatively small, throughout the first year collaborations and partnerships were established with a variety of groups as well as with other entities not strictly known as lab or center research entities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Center for Digital Humanities, College of Humanities, University of Arizona (Director: Bryan Carter, Ph.D)</li>
<li>Cochise College lab, Computer Information Systems and Computer Science, Cochise College (Director: Timothy McDaniel)</li>

<p>Originally planned for room B-154 on the Sierra Vista campus, the lab was moved to room B-158. Renovations of the campus included having the room and carpet cleaned, the walls painted, and the televisions and furniture from the old room moved. The wall-mounted sensors for head-mounted displays (HMDs) were also installed by the campus facilities crew. A large wooden grid bookshelf was moved into the space and Styrafoam heads purchased to display HMDs.

<p>A Provost Investment Fund (PIF) was submitted in 2021 to develop a platform to support intra-organizational collaboration on various XR-related projects for students, faculty, and staff at the university. While this was ultimately not chosen for funding, the feedback stated a very clear and understood need for this type of engagement. To expand the reach of the platform, it was decided the project would be better served as a startup company. TechLaunch, the university’s business incubator, was approached. Also very encouraged and excited about the prospect, they have committed to an initial investment of $50,000 to support the initial development of the platform, to develop the organizational structure, and identify ongoing investment funding sources.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="protocolsio">Protocols.io</h2>
<p>Protocols.io is an online platform that specializes in publishing step-by-step processes regarding, especially, laboratory procedures. As some of the software and equipment in the lab requires complicated setup and, given the limited physical space available, must be setup and broken down repeatedly, having clear, transparent protocols has been invaluable. Protocols can also be linked bidirectionally to published research using DOIs, which can be generated for OSF objects.</p>
